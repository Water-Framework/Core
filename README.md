    ```
4.  **Using Primary Modules:**

    *   **Core-api:** This module defines the core interfaces and abstract classes that form the foundation of the Water Core framework. To use this module, you would typically depend on it in your project and implement the interfaces it defines. For example, you might implement the `BaseEntityApi` interface to create a service for managing entities.

    *   **Core-bundle:** This module handles component initialization and registration. To use this module, you would typically create an `AbstractInitializer` to register your components with the `ComponentRegistry`. This ensures that your components are properly managed by the framework.

    *   **Core-interceptors:** This module provides method interception capabilities, allowing you to implement cross-cutting concerns such as security and logging. To use this module, you would define `MethodInterceptor` implementations and annotate your methods with custom annotations that trigger the interceptors.

    *   **Core-model:** This module defines the core data models used throughout the Water Core framework. To use this module, you would typically extend the `BaseEntity` interface for your entities and use the provided annotations for validation.

    *   **Core-permission:** This module implements the permission management system, allowing you to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions. To use this module, you would typically define `Action` objects for your resources and use the `@AllowPermissions` annotation to secure your methods.

    *   **Core-registry:** This module manages the registration and discovery of components. To use this module, you would typically register your components with the `ComponentRegistry` and use `ComponentFilter` objects to retrieve them.

    *   **Core-security:** This module provides security-related components and utilities, such as authentication and encryption. To use this module, you would typically configure the `SecurityContext` and use the `EncryptionUtil` to encrypt and decrypt data.

    *   **Core-service:** This module implements the base service classes and integration utilities. To use this module, you would typically extend the `BaseService` class for your services and use the provided integration clients to interact with other services.

    *   **Core-testing-utils:** This module provides utilities for testing Water Core-based applications. To use this module, you would typically use the provided base classes and mock implementations to write unit and integration tests.

    *   **Core-validation:** This module implements custom validation annotations and validators. To use this module, you would typically annotate your data models with the provided annotations and use the `WaterValidator` to validate them.
5.  **Configuration:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Define environment variables to configure application behavior (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`).
    *   **Service Registration:** Register services using the `ComponentRegistry` API, specifying the implementation class and any required properties.
    *   **Security Setup:** Configure authentication providers and permission settings within the `SecurityContext`.
6.  **Minimal Usage Patterns:**
    *   **Registering a Component:** Provide a configuration file (e.g., `component.properties`) with component-specific settings.  Register the component using `ComponentRegistry.registerComponent()`.
    *   **Securing a Method:** Annotate a method with `@AllowPermissions(actions = "READ")` to enforce permission checks before execution.
    *   **Accessing Application Properties:** Retrieve application properties using `ApplicationProperties.getProperty("propertyName")`.

## Functional Analysis

### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The primary responsibilities of the Water Core project include:

*   **Component Lifecycle Management:** Providing a mechanism for registering, discovering, and managing the lifecycle of software components. This is facilitated by the `ComponentRegistry` and related classes.
*   **Security Enforcement:** Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application. The `SecurityContext`, `PermissionManager`, and related annotations play a crucial role in this.
*   **Data Access Abstraction:** Offering a consistent way to interact with data repositories, regardless of the underlying technology. The `BaseRepository`, `Query`, and `QueryBuilder` classes provide this abstraction.
*   **Event Handling:** Enabling components to communicate asynchronously through events. The `ApplicationEventProducer` and `ApplicationEventListener` interfaces facilitate this.
*   **REST API Exposure:** Providing a framework for exposing application functionality as RESTful APIs. The `RestApi` interface and related annotations are used for this purpose.
*   **Configuration Management:** Loading and managing application-wide properties. The `ApplicationProperties` class provides this functionality.
*   **Method Interception:** Allowing developers to intercept method calls for implementing cross-cutting concerns. The `MethodInterceptor` interface and related annotations are used for this.
*    **Data Validation:** Providing a mechanism for validating data and resources, ensuring data integrity and consistency. The `WaterValidator` interface and related annotations are used for this.

At its core, the Water Core project provides foundational services and abstractions that simplify the development of robust, scalable, and secure applications. It manages the complexities of component management, security, data access, and other common concerns, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic.

### 2. Problems the System Solves

The Water Core project addresses several key challenges in application development:

*   **Complexity of Component Management:** Managing dependencies and lifecycles of components can be complex, especially in large applications. The `ComponentRegistry` simplifies this by providing a central point for registering, discovering, and managing components.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Implementing security correctly can be challenging and error-prone. The Water Core project provides a comprehensive security framework that simplifies authentication, authorization, and data protection.
*   **Data Access Inconsistencies:** Interacting with different data repositories can lead to inconsistencies and code duplication. The `BaseRepository` and related classes provide a consistent way to access data, regardless of the underlying technology.
*   **Lack of Asynchronous Communication:** Synchronous communication between components can lead to performance bottlenecks and tight coupling. The event handling mechanism enables asynchronous communication, improving performance and reducing coupling.
*   **Difficulty in Exposing Functionality as APIs:** Creating and managing RESTful APIs can be time-consuming and complex. The Water Core project simplifies this by providing a framework for exposing application functionality as APIs.
*   **Configuration Management Headaches:** Managing application-wide properties can be difficult, especially in distributed environments. The `ApplicationProperties` class provides a centralized way to load, manage, and access properties.
*   **Code Duplication and Tangled Code:** Implementing cross-cutting concerns such as logging and security can lead to code duplication and tangled code. Method interception allows developers to implement these concerns in a modular and reusable way.
*    **Data Integrity Issues:** Ensuring that data is valid and consistent can be challenging. The Water Core project provides a validation framework that simplifies this process.

By addressing these challenges, the Water Core project enables developers to build applications more quickly, efficiently, and securely.

### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The modules and components within the Water Core project interact in a well-defined and loosely coupled manner. Here are some key interaction patterns:

*   **Dependency Injection:** Components declare their dependencies using the `@Inject` annotation. The `WaterComponentsInjector` then resolves these dependencies from the `ComponentRegistry` and injects them into the components. This promotes loose coupling and testability.
*   **Event Handling:** Components can raise events using the `ApplicationEventProducer` interface. Other components can implement the `ApplicationEventListener` interface to receive these events. This enables asynchronous communication and reduces coupling.
*   **Permission Enforcement:** Methods can be secured using the `@AllowPermissions` and `@AllowRoles` annotations. Interceptors then use the `SecurityContext` and `PermissionManager` to check if the current user has the required permissions before executing the method.
*   **Data Access:** Services interact with data repositories through the `BaseRepository` interface. Queries are constructed using the `QueryBuilder` and executed against the repository.
*   **REST API Exposure:** Classes annotated with `@FrameworkRestApi` are registered with the `RestApiRegistry`. The framework then uses this registry to expose the classes as REST resources.

These interaction patterns are enabled by a combination of design patterns, architectural decisions, and shared interfaces. For example, the use of interfaces promotes loose coupling, while the use of annotations enables declarative configuration and security.

### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

The Water Core project provides both user-facing and system-facing functionalities:

*   **User-Facing Functionalities:**
    *   **REST APIs:** The `@FrameworkRestApi` annotation allows developers to expose application functionality as RESTful APIs. These APIs can be consumed by end users or other systems.
    *   **User Interface Components:** While the Water Core project itself does not provide UI components, it provides the foundation for building UI components that interact with the underlying services and data models.
    *   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The project could be extended to provide a CLI for managing and interacting with the system.
*   **System-Facing Functionalities:**
    *   **Component Management:** The `ComponentRegistry` and related classes are used to manage the lifecycle of software components. This is primarily a system-facing functionality.
    *   **Security Enforcement:** The `SecurityContext`, `PermissionManager`, and related annotations are used to secure the application. This is primarily a system-facing functionality, although it has a direct impact on the user experience.
    *   **Data Access Abstraction:** The `BaseRepository` and related classes provide a consistent way to interact with data repositories. This is primarily a system-facing functionality, as it abstracts away the details of the underlying data storage technology.
    *   **Event Handling:** The `ApplicationEventProducer` and `ApplicationEventListener` interfaces are used to enable asynchronous communication between components. This is primarily a system-facing functionality, as it enables the decoupling of components and improves performance.
    *   **Configuration Management:** The `ApplicationProperties` class is used to load and manage application-wide properties. This is primarily a system-facing functionality, as it provides a central point for configuring the application.

The system-facing functionalities provide the foundation for building robust and scalable applications. The user-facing functionalities provide the interface for users to interact with the applications.

Additionally, explicitly identify and document:

* The `Service` interface and `BaseService` abstract class systematically apply common behaviors across all implementing or extending classes. While specific annotations aren't enforced directly on the interface, the framework is designed around the concept of services and APIs, often leading to consistent application of annotations related to security (`@AllowPermissions`, `@AllowRoles`), and component registration (`@FrameworkComponent`) on implementing classes. This promotes consistent functionality and shared behavior across service implementations.


## Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

The Water Core project applies several architectural patterns and design principles to achieve its goals:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The system is designed around reusable and modular components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Services expose well-defined interfaces and can be discovered and consumed by other components, enabling loose coupling and interoperability.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI):** Components are injected with their dependencies, promoting loose coupling, testability, and modularity.  The `@Inject` annotation and `WaterComponentInjector` are key parts of this pattern.
*   **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Interceptors are used to implement cross-cutting concerns such as security and logging, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.  Annotations like `@AllowPermissions` combined with `MethodInterceptor` implementations exemplify AOP.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions are managed based on user roles, simplifying security management and ensuring consistent access control.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Components communicate through events, enabling asynchronous and loosely coupled interactions, improving performance and scalability.
*   **Layered Architecture:** The code is organized into layers (API, bundle, model, etc.) to separate concerns, improving maintainability and reducing complexity.
*   **Interface-Based Design:** Many components are defined as interfaces, allowing for multiple implementations and easier mocking for testing, promoting flexibility and testability.
*   **Annotations:** Annotations are used extensively for configuration, dependency injection, permission management, and other aspects of the system, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.
*   **SOLID Principles:** The code attempts to adhere to SOLID principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), promoting maintainability and extensibility.
